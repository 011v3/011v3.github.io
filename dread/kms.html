            i do not believe in my ability to do well. i am afraid
            that everyone dislikes everything about me and does not
            care about any of the things that i do. i am incapable
            of maintaining close friendships because i push people away
            for fear they will hurt me. i also have let long standing
            friendships wither and die. when they try to reconnect i 
            find it difficult to reciprocate. i find it difficult to
            express emotion to strangers and i hide my true feelings to 
            everyone. my true feelings feel desperate and dark.

            i do not call my grandma often enough. she says she loves me
            but i forget what that feels like. i do not call my mom because
            i can't stand speaking to her. i do not know how to mend our relationship
            and i resent that it is up to me to do so. i do not call my brother
            often because i do not know if that would be welcome although i wish
            it were so. i am alienated from my family because i was a disagreeable
            child growing up.

            i feel stuck in life and i don't have the motivation to pull 
            myself out of the hole i am in. i am too comfortable inside my hole
            and as much as i want to leave, i don't. i work many hours at a job
            that does not pay me enough money. my finances always feel drained and 
            i can't spend my money the way i want to. i'm unable to keep my living space
            adequately clean and i'm constantly dissatisfied with my surroundings. i feel
            like i do not have the same level of freedom that i once was able to 
            experience in life and i resent myself for having let my will be broken.
