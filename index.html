    <br>
    They have a great sense of observation and quickly grasp and size up the situation. They are crafty, subtle, and perceptive.
    <br>
    They are very devoted, but may not always show emotions; they don't always let themselves go, either through fear of ridicule or through fear of not being loved in return as much as they love. They are therefore sometimes too undemonstrative. May give off the sense that their love is not for free. Caring but worries that they are not exciting enough. Careful with money.
